The Agreement Engine is a software model for the creation, representation, and enforcement of all different kinds of agreements. This project is part of the [Metagovernance Project](www.metagov.org), an interdisciplinary research project focused on the governance of virtual worlds. This repository is an experimental implementation of the Agreement Engine that exists on Twitter. To read more about what it does and how it works, take a look at our [blog post](https://thelastjosh.medium.com/introducing-the-agreement-engine-bf03b6d5c16c). You can find our roadmap and goals for the project in the [PRD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gy8tMuRrCbK3i7Go6s-sUK6nHNOz81ccfYzKQXeiW2E/edit?usp=sharing).
